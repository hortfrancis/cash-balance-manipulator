# Cash Balance Manipulator

Location: [hortfrancis.github.io/cash-balance-manipulator](https://hortfrancis.github.io/cash-balance-manipulator/)

This project demonstrates a web user interface for manipulating a cash balance, using React, with Redux. 

Along with adding or subtracting an amount to the balance, the user can add interest at a fixed rate of 5% or apply a charge to the balance at a fixed rate of 15%. 

The page is responsive and should work well at all screen sizes (mobile or desktop, etc). 

**React** is a library used by frontend developers to create web applications that are fast and responsive. It allows developers to build UI components that update automatically as the user interacts with the application, without having to reload the entire page. This makes the application more efficient and responsive, which improves the user experience.

**Redux** is a tool that helps developers manage the information in their web applications. It makes it easier for developers to store and share information between different parts of the application, which is important for building complex web applications. 

In this project, Redux is used to hold the value of the balance amount separately to the user interface components.
